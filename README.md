# W29VM

W29VM is a Virtual Machine (VM) service designed specifically for middle to high school students using Chromebooks. It allows students to run educational Windows programs on their devices, enabling them to access software that may not be available on their school-issued Chromebooks. This service is intended solely for educational purposes and adheres to the rules and guidelines established by educational institutions.

The service is an online tool that is **heavily monitored** to ensure compliance with educational goals and prevent misuse (and gaming).

## Features

- **Virtual Machine Access**: Students can access educational Windows programs through virtual machines running on a server.
- **Secure and Compliant**: The service complies with school policies and Hapara Dashboard rules. It is strictly intended for educational activities.
- **Dynamic VM Access**: Due to IP address changes, the service uses a specific tool to launch the portal and automatically redirects the user to the correct virtual machine host.
- **Customizable**: Schools can request modifications to the VMs to cater to specific educational needs.

## How it Works

1. **Application Process**: Students must apply for an account and VM access via a **Google Form**. After submitting the application, students will be granted access to their personalized virtual machine.
2. **Virtual Machine Setup**: The virtual machines (VMs) are hosted on a server and configured to run various educational software. These VMs can be accessed via a web portal.
3. **Access the VM**: After accepting the Terms of Service, students can launch their VM by clicking the **"Access my VM"** button. The portal automatically redirects the user to the appropriate IP address for the VM.
4. **Terms of Service**: To use the service, students must accept the Terms of Service (TOS) which outlines the acceptable use policy, including compliance with school guidelines and the prohibition of gaming and other non-educational activities.

## Portal

Visit the [W29VM Portal](https://wicorn29.github.io/W29VM/) to access everything you need to get started with the W29VM service. This portal is your hub for applying for a VM, viewing the Terms of Service, and launching your virtual machine.

## Terms of Service (TOS)

### Steps

1. **Set Up Virtualization Software**: Install and configure your preferred virtualization platform on the server.
2. **Create Virtual Machines**: Set up VMs with the necessary educational software installed.
3. **Configure Access Portal**: Host the access portal (a simple HTML page with Terms of Service acceptance and VM launch functionality).
4. **Monitor Usage**: Ensure the service is being used appropriately and monitor for any violations of the Terms of Service.

## Usage

To access your VM:

1. **Apply for Access**: Fill out the **Google Form** to apply for an account and virtual machine. Once approved, you will be granted access to the VM.
2. **Accept the Terms of Service**: Upon receiving access, you must accept the Terms of Service.
3. **Launch your VM**: After accepting the TOS, click on the **"Access my VM"** link, which will redirect you to the appropriate IP address for your VM.
