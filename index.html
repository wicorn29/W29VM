    <h1>Why You Can't Block Changing IP Addresses</h1>
    <p>
        It seems that in the modern age of technology, there are still some who believe blocking IP addresses is an effective
        strategy to control network access. In reality, dynamic IP allocation, a fundamental concept in networking, makes
        blocking IP addresses not only ineffective but also a bit outdated.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dynamic IP allocation, used by most ISPs, means that users get assigned different IP addresses each time they connect
        to the internet or at random intervals during their session. This rotation ensures that IP addresses are reused and
        reallocated, making any attempt to block a specific address laughably futile. It’s almost as if the people trying to
        block these addresses are unaware of the technology they’re trying to control.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moreover, many users today have access to technologies like VPNs and proxies that completely circumvent these
        supposed “blocks.” So even if someone were to somehow block an IP, it would be no more than a minor inconvenience for
        anyone who actually knows how to use basic networking tools.
    </p>

    <h1>Let's Play the IP Blocking Game, Again</h1>

    <p>
        Here’s the fun part: I’ve played this blocking game before. In fact, I have plenty of experience from my old school district
        where they tried to block everything in sight—only to fail over and over again. One of the best moments was when I got the
        "idiots" in charge of the network to block Google’s Chromebook login IP, causing school to be out for a day. They were
        so oblivious to what they were doing that it took a full day for them to realize they had blocked the entire school’s access
        to their Chromebooks. That was some top-tier incompetence.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, if you're reading this as a representative of the Sherwood School District and think that blocking this service will
        somehow stop me, I’m here to let you know that you’re mistaken. You might try blocking the IP, you might try blocking the
        page, but guess what? You’re just wasting your time—and I’ve got plenty of time to waste right along with you.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you still want to remove this service, you can reach out to me directly at
        <a href="mailto:wilsonharriscorn@gmail.com">wicorn29@gmail.com</a>. However, I think we both know this is just a game that can go on
        indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p>
        To be clear, this service does not violate the Sherwood Middle School student handbook, and any random blocking attempts
        will be ignored as mistakes—perhaps due to a lack of understanding, but nonetheless, ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>No, blocking this GitHub Pages site won't do anything, in case that's what you were wondering. All it will do is let me know that you are unable (or too scared) to engage in civil conversation with your students, and I’ll treat any future attempts accordingly in future updates to this service.</strong>
